# Distance-Based Classification Project

This project (under our Sem 4 course Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition lab) demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow that includes distance-based classification using face detection and clustering. The project follows the provided requirements, integrating key tools such as:

- **Weights & Biases (WandB):** for experiment tracking and logging.
- **Docker:** to containerize the application ensuring environment consistency.
- **GitHub Actions:** for continuous integration and automated testing.

## main.py is the main file to be run
